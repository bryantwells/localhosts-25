notes: 
  - Before asking where a website can go, it might be helpful to understand where (most) websites are (spoiler alert, the answer is North Virginia). 
  - The internet is dependent on the relationship between two computers, one called a "client" (your computer), and another called a "server" (the computer sending you something)
