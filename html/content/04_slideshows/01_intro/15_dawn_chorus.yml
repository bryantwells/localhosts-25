notes: 
  - Sometimes I make objects
  - This is a MIDI controller I initially created for a network performance done over a web server / local internet radio station i  started here in the atrium in 2018 that ran until 2022 or so. Anyway, the performance is called 'Dawn Chorus' and uses the audience's cell phones as speakers for a synthesized bird sound.
  - Each person would receive the sound at slightly different times, depending on the speed of their connection. The piece is ultimately about latency (the delay between a transmission by a server and it's reception by a client).
