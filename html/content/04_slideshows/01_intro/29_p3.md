P3: Log (10wks)

Use your server to host a 'Log' (a method of recording, a method of publishing, an archive/collection) related to a topic or concept of your choice, to be installed in and/or accessed from a location of your choice. Your log should contain ~25-50 entries and be designed to be viewed within a particular space or situation. Consider how the conditions of your website's use may contextualize the content. What kind of behavioral, viewing, or reading experience do you want to support? 

This project will be broken into five parts: Concept, Design, Prototyping, Final, and Documentation.
