notes: 
  - Sometimes I make objects
  - This is a MIDI controller I created for a sound performance called 'Dawn Chorus' which involves a web server and uses the audiences cell phones as speakers
  - The piece is ultimately about latency (the delay between a transmission by a server and it's reception by a client)
