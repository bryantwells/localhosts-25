notes: 
  - Before getting into the syllabus, I figured I would introduce myself and show some work so you know where I'm coming from.
  - My name is Bryant, I'm a designer based in NYC. I often make work between and across mediums, but most of my work uses programming in one form or another.
  - Of course, a big part of that is making websites...
