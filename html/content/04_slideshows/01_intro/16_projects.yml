notes:
  - I haven't structured this class in this way before, so it is a bit of an experiment
  - Historically, the class has been more of a tutorial course, with individual workshops that lead into 5-6 smaller projects.
  - This semester, we will still start off with some smaller projects in the first few weeks, then eventually transisiton into one larger project (broken into phases).
