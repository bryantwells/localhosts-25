P2: Field Notes (2wks)

Establish a method of observing an aspect of the world around you. Your approach should be less about comprehensive documentation and more about identifying the unusual, the poetic, and the subtle. Create a set of 'field notes' that reflect your observations. While each entry should be unique, they should be consistent in format. Create a website that contains an index of your notes, as well as a page for each individual entry. The next time we meet, you will use this website to support a 5-10 minute reading of your work.
