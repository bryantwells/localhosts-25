caption: <i>Packet Sniffer</i>
notes: 
 This is an app I developed – a packet sniffer, which displays packets of data as they are sent over a wifi network. The app also doubles as a type specimen for a family of fonts called Hershey, an early vector typeface originally made by the navy for radar-based weapons systems. This typeface is now ubiquitous in the graphics programming world – its dataset was published by the US Gov in 1967. I like to show this because it helps illustrate a couple things,
 
1) The internet has changed the fabric of our world on a molecular level. These packets literally travel over air.
2) The patterns and behavioural tendencies which are fundamental in our use of technology and the internet are often inherited from imperial, capitalist goals of surveillance, extraction, commodification, etc.
