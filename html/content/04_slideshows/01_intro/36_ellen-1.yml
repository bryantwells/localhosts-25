notes: 
  - Ellen Fabini made a plugin for Chrome called 'Data Resurrector', with scraped data from Google Takeout (Google's service which keeps tabs on your internet behaviour across its platforms). On load, the plugin 'ressurects' a piece of data from your archive. She presented her work in the 'graveyard' / computer lab upstairs.
