notes: 
  - My name is Bryant, I'm a designer based in NYC. I often make work in a different mediums, but much of my work uses programming in one form or another.
  - Of course, a big part of that is making websites. This is a website I did for Dweller, which is a techno festival and writing platform focused on providing a space for black electronic musicians as well as critical perspectives on the music industry.
  - The site uses the line counter (reminiscent of a punch card, a terminal, or a code editor) as a basis for the site's typography and image rendering.
