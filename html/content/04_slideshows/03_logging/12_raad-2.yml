notes: 
  - The work consists a series of annotations of the notebook, which describe how a group of historians (with differing political agendas) would gather on Sundays to bet on horses. 
  - They wouldnt bet on the horses themselves, but on the amount of distance between the horseâ€™s nose and the finish line as captured in the photo-finish image.
