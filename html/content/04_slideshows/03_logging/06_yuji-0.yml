notes:
  - logging can be a form of creaative production
  - Yuji Agematsu's work is centered around walking
  - the artist walks around and collects debris of a neighborhood, which he then stores within the celophane of a cigarette pack
  - his work represents "the metabolism of the city and the habits and desires of its residents"
