caption: Opening and Closing Doors and Drawers, FLUXUS Midwest
notes:
  - Fluxus is an art collective / movement known for their instructional performances and durational art
  - Much of the work involves establishing a rule (a score) for a situation, and the resulting composition would be based on the fulfillment of that score
  - This is a website by "Fluxus Midwest" (i dont actually know who that is) but is a good example of the Fluxus ethos
