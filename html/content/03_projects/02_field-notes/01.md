Establish a method of observing an aspect of the world (physical, or digital) around you. Your approach should be less about comprehensive documentation and more about identifying the unusual, the poetic, and the subtle. Create a set of 'field notes' that reflect your observations. While each entry should be unique, they should be consistent in format. Create a website that contains an index of your notes, as well as a page for each individual entry. The next time we meet, you will use this website to support a ~5 minute reading of your work.

Upload your website so it is accessible from your raspberry PI's IP address and is in a folder on the same level as your index.html file and your "Time Online" project. At this point, your website's folder structure should look something like this:

```
ðŸ“‚ /var/www/html/
â”œâ”€ ðŸ“„ index.html
â”œâ”€ ðŸ“‚ time-online/
â””â”€ ðŸ“‚ field-notes/
   â”œâ”€ ðŸ“‚ assets
   â”‚  â””â”€ ðŸ“„ style.css
   â”œâ”€ ðŸ“‚ media
   â”‚  â”œâ”€ ðŸ“„ filename-1.png
   â”‚  â”œâ”€ ðŸ“„ filename-2.png
   â”‚  â””â”€ ðŸ“„ [...]
   â”œâ”€ ðŸ“‚ entries
   â”‚  â”œâ”€ ðŸ“„ 1.html
   â”‚  â”œâ”€ ðŸ“„ 2.html
   â”‚  â””â”€ ðŸ“„ [...]
   â””â”€ ðŸ“„ index.html
```
