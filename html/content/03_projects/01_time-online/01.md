Due 9/10

Write about a formative or significant memory you've had online. Use HTML elements, links, media, and basic styles as needed to create a web page that illustrates your story.

Upload your website so it is accessible from your raspberry PI's IP address. At this point, your website's folder should have the following structure:

```
ðŸ“‚ html/
â”‚
â”œâ”€ ðŸ“„ index.html 
â”œâ”€ ðŸŒ¸ favicon.ico 
â”‚
â””â”€ ðŸ“‚ time-online/

```
