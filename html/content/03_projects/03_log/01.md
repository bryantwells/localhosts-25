Use your server to host a "Log" — a method of recording, publishing, or archiving — related to a topic or concept of your choice. This log should be installed in and/or accessed from a location of your choice. Consider how the conditions of your website’s use will contextualize it's content. What kind of behavioral, viewing, or reading experience do you want to support? Is it a publication that can only be accessed from a particular location? Is it a website designed for a specific situation? Is it an installation with a passive display, a new method of distribution, a performance companion, or something else? Regardless, your piece should have a physical component that marks your work's existence.

This project will be divided into five parts: Concept, Design, Prototype, Final Presentation, and Documentation.

## Part 1: Concept (due 10.09)
Prepare to share a few pontential log topic/concepts with the class. Consider the following:

- design / interface vernacular
- physical implications
- potential interaction methods
- related or referential websites/works
- related writing
- potential content or content development methods
- content structure/schema

## Part 2: Design (due 11.06)
Prepare to share design mockups and/or code sketches of the key elements of your project to demonstrate progress. By this stage, you should have narrowed down your concept and potential location. Consider methods of display and interaction.

## Part 3: Prototype (due 11.20)
Prepare to share a working prototype of your project's most critical components, with most of the content completed. By this stage, you should be ready to install your work and begin the debugging process.

## Part 4: Final Review (12.04)
Prepare your finished work and final presentation for review – we will visit everyone’s server in-situ.

## Part 5: Documentation (due 12.11)
On the last day of class, bring a thumbnail image or video representing your work. We will collectively submit your work to a shared archive on the class server and on GitHub. Students who wish to archive their work online can do so on this day as well.
